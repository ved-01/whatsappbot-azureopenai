## Step 1: Select Phone Numbers

- Make sure WhatsApp is added to your App.
- You begin with a test number that you can use to send messages to up to 5 numbers.
- Go to API Setup and locate the test number from which you will be sending messages.
- Here, you can also add numbers to send messages to. Enter your **own WhatsApp number**.
- You will receive a code on your phone via WhatsApp to verify your number.

## Step 2: Send Messages with the API

1. Obtain a 24-hour access token from the API access section.
2. It will show an example of how to send messages using a `curl` command which can be send from the terminal or with a tool like Postman.
3. Let's convert that into a [Python function with the request library]
4. Create a `.env` files based on `example.env` and update the required variables.
5. You will receive a "Hello World" message (Expect a 60-120 second delay for the message).

Creating an access that works longer then 24 hours
1. Create a [system user at the Meta Business account level](https://business.facebook.com/settings/system-users).
2. On the System Users page, configure the assets for your System User, assigning your WhatsApp app with full control. Don't forget to click the Save Changes button.
3. Now click `Generate new token` and select the app, and then choose how long the access token will be valid. You can choose 60 days or never expire.
4. Select all the permissions, as I was running into errors when I only selected the WhatsApp ones.
5. Confirm and copy the access token.

Now we have to find the following information on the **App Dashboard**:

- **APP_ID**: "<YOUR-WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-APP_ID>" (Found at App Dashboard)
- **APP_SECRET**: "<YOUR-WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-APP_SECRET>" (Found at App Dashboard)
- **RECIPIENT_WAID**: "<YOUR-RECIPIENT-TEST-PHONE-NUMBER>" (This is your WhatsApp ID, i.e., phone number. Make sure it is added to the account as shown in the example test message.)
- **VERSION**: "v18.0" (The latest version of the Meta Graph API)
- **ACCESS_TOKEN**: "<YOUR-SYSTEM-USER-ACCESS-TOKEN>" (Created in the previous step)

> You can only send a template type message as your first message to a user. That's why you have to send a reply first before we continue. 


## Step 3: Configure Webhooks to Receive Messages

> Please note, this is the hardest part of this tutorial.

#### Start your app
- Make you have a python installation or environment and install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run your Flask app locally by executing [run.py]

#### Launch ngrok

The steps below are taken from the [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/integrations/whatsapp/webhooks/).

> You need a static ngrok domain because Meta validates your ngrok domain and certificate!

Once your app is running successfully on localhost, let's get it on the internet securely using ngrok!

1. If you're not an ngrok user yet, just sign up for ngrok for free.
2. Download the ngrok agent.
3. Go to the ngrok dashboard, click Your [Authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken), and copy your Authtoken.
4. Follow the instructions to authenticate your ngrok agent. You only have to do this once.
5. On the left menu, expand Cloud Edge and then click Domains.
6. On the Domains page, click + Create Domain or + New Domain. (here everyone can start with [one free domain](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/free-static-domains-ngrok-users))
7. Start ngrok by running the following command in a terminal on your local desktop:
```
ngrok http 8000 --domain your-domain.ngrok-free.app
```
8. ngrok will display a URL where your localhost application is exposed to the internet (copy this URL for use with Meta).


#### Integrate WhatsApp

In the Meta App Dashboard, go to WhatsApp > Configuration, then click the Edit button.
1. In the Edit webhook's callback URL popup, enter the URL provided by the ngrok agent to expose your application to the internet in the Callback URL field, with /webhook at the end (i.e. https://myexample.ngrok-free.app/webhook).
2. Enter a verification token. This string is set up by you when you create your webhook endpoint. You can pick any string you like. Make sure to update this in your `VERIFY_TOKEN` environment variable.
3. After you add a webhook to WhatsApp, WhatsApp will submit a validation post request to your application through ngrok. Confirm your localhost app receives the validation get request and logs `WEBHOOK_VERIFIED` in the terminal.
4. Back to the Configuration page, click Manage.
5. On the Webhook fields popup, click Subscribe to the **messages** field. Tip: You can subscribe to multiple fields.
6. If your Flask app and ngrok are running, you can click on "Test" next to messages to test the subscription. You recieve a test message in upper case. If that is the case, your webhook is set up correctly.


#### Testing the Integration
Use the phone number associated to your WhatsApp product or use the test number you copied before.
1. Add this number to your WhatsApp app contacts and then send a message to this number.
2. Confirm your localhost app receives a message and logs both headers and body in the terminal.
3. Test if the bot replies back to you in upper case.
4. You have now succesfully integrated the bot! ðŸŽ‰
5. Now it's time to acutally build cool things with this.
